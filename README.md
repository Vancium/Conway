## Description
My implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. A zero player game, which is deterministic by its initial state. 


## ToDo's
- [ ]  Attach key-presses to events (i.e clear, stop, start, step)
- [ ]  Currently bounded by N*N vector, expand to N + 2 * N + 2, and index from (1, 1) -> (N, N) for 'infinite grid'
- [ ] light theme
- [ ] ncurses for terminal display
- [ ] user input
